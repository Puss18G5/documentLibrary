\section{Introduction}
This document describes the requirements for the the system. It is a system that helps commuters car pool between cities. The users should be able to add the routes they will be driving and search for routes they would like to ride with somebody.

The system is developed by group 5 of the course ETSN05 2018.

\section{Reference documents}
There are no referenced documents for this version.
\section{Background and goals}

\subsection{Main goals}
The main goal of the system is to make it easier for commuters to car pool. This would hopefully reduce traffic in heavily trafficked areas and make the the commuting less stressful for everyone.  
\subsection{Actors}
There are two main actors using the system

\textbf{User:} The users can be divided into two different roles, the driver and the commuter. Each physical person can have either role, although one person can never have both roles at the same time.

\textbf{Administrator:} The administrator is a special case user of the system. The administrator can add and remove users, rides and locations from the system. 

\section{Terminology}
\textbf{username:} The unique name of a user inside the system.
\\
\textbf{password:} A word or phrase used for authentication by the user.
\\
\textbf{ride:} Information about who is going to drive as well as from where to where, departure time, arrival time, and the number of seats available.

\section{Context and activity diagram}
